# OSLO Playground

To help developers create JSON-LD data, Information Flanders has developed a playground where they can create and validate their JSON-LD data. This playground is an implementation of the already exisiting [JSON-LD Playground](https://json-ld.org/playground/). It has 2 important features:
1. Parsing JSON-LD - Users can create JSON-LD and parse it
1. Validation - Users can immediatly validate their data snippet against the application profiles from the OSLO Validator
